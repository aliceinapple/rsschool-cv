### About Me:
>My name is Victoria, I am a beginner Front-end developer. I have never worked in IT and I have absolutely no commercial experience, but I would really like to acquire it.
In my spare time, I make simple web pages. Everything I know, I have learned from books, articles, video tutorials and through practice, almost entirely on my own. I know this is not enough, but I can say that I can work and study on my own.
I want to further develop in the field of Front-end development.
I easily find a common language with new people and know how to work in a team.

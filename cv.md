### About Me:
>My name is Victoria, I am a beginner Front-end developer. I have never worked in IT and I have absolutely no commercial experience, but I would really like to acquire it.
In my spare time, I make simple web pages. Everything I know, I have learned from books, articles, video tutorials and through practice, almost entirely on my own. I know this is not enough, but I can say that I can work and study on my own.
I want to further develop in the field of Front-end development.
I easily find a common language with new people and know how to work in a team.

### Skills:
* JavaScript (Basic)
* HTML5
* CSS3/SCSS

### Code Example:
**"Are they the "same"?" from *codewars*:**
>*Given two arrays a and b write a function comp(a, b) that checks whether the two arrays have the "same" elements, with the same multiplicities (the multiplicity of a member is the number of times it appears). "Same" means, here, that the elements in b are the elements in a squared, regardless of the order.*

```
function comp(array1, array2) {

  if (array1 === null || array2 === null) {
    return false
  }
  
  return array1.map(item => item**2).sort().join() === array2.sort().join()
}

console.log(comp([2, 2, 3], [4, 9, 9]))
```
